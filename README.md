# Secure_File_Encryption_and_Decryption_System.ipynb
This project implements a secure file encryption and decryption system using AES-256 encryption algorithm in Python. The system ensures data confidentiality and integrity through the use of nonce and authentication tags to prevent tampering.

ðŸ›  Features:
AES-256 Encryption: Strong encryption standard for securing files.

Nonce & Authentication Tags: Provides additional security to prevent unauthorized file tampering.

Key-based Decryption: Files can only be decrypted with the correct secret key.

Python Implementation: Built using Python with libraries like Cryptography.

ðŸ“„ Use Case:
This tool is ideal for encrypting sensitive files and ensuring secure transfer or storage. Only authorized users with the decryption key can access the original content, providing strong protection for private data.

ðŸš€ Technologies:
Python

Cryptography library for AES encryption
